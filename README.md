# UsedCar-Analysis
The objective of this project is to create visual representations of a Craigslist dataset containing information about used cars. These visualizations are intended to assist individuals in their search for dependable and affordable vehicles.
# Introduction
The project addresses two main questions for a persona:

1) What insights can be gained about the used car market in New York and neighboring states based on price differences between states and manufacturers?
2) What can be learned about the reliability and maintenance costs of used cars based on various elements such as year, mileage, and condition?
The visualizations aim to provide Sarah with a clear understanding of the used car market and help her make informed decisions.
# Data
The project utilizes the Used Cars Dataset obtained from Kaggle, which provides information about used cars and trucks sold on Craigslist. The dataset includes various variables such as the car's model, price, manufacturer, condition, year, fuel type, transmission, and drive type. To ensure accuracy, the dataset underwent thorough cleaning, including the removal of missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns. The final dataset includes the most relevant nine columns.
